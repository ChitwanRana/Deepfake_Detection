🧠 Deepfake Detection System
  🚨 Overview
    Deepfake Detection System is a cutting-edge web application that helps identify whether a given image or video is real or AI-generated (deepfake). Powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like VGG16 and other deep learning models, the system aims to combat misinformation and protect individuals from AI-driven manipulation.
    Built with Django for a robust backend and a user-friendly frontend, this project is not just a detection tool—it’s a step toward digital safety and social justice.
